## Graphite + StatsD
_2016/09_

The common Graphite and StatsD combination is a metrics collection and
aggregation facility, enriched and scaled up by StatsD. It represents
a pragmatic tradeoff between the various existing time-series databases.


## Kafka
_2016/02_

[Originally](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/srikanth/netdb11/netdb11papers/netdb11-final12.pdf)
at LinkedIn has been used for data-as-stream, "log" processing, and creating a
"marketplace" of stream data. 


## Microservices

Though it is [hard to describe](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) in a short

we prefer building multiple, smaller, units, to support agility, scalability
and flexibility in software engineering.


## Redis

Redis is a fast key-value store with advanced data structures and concurrency primitives.
