## A Unified Service Stack
_2016/09_

A service stack per technology platform and workload that will bring together production aspects
that we value, in addition for supporting the Microservices architecture style. Things like: correlation-id,
throttling, circuit-breakers, structured logging, health, tracing, metrics and more, will now be part
of a stack that you use in a new project; whether it is a bunch of middleware or a boilerplate project.

See: [kraken.js](http://krakenjs.com).


## Contracts
_2016/09_

Micro-service architectures demand an increased integration overhead. To make integration
predictable, easy and robust, we need to use contracts. This may mean: Swagger contracts
that are documentation-first, and / or JSON-schema contracts that are code-first. Web
frameworks should have integrated support for those so that it becomes streamlined.
